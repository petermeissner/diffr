# diffr 
A package for measuring change between different versions of text

## Description


A package for measuring change between different versions of text by automatically
or semi-automatically aligning text lines and measuring the change. It works kind of like diff
or version control systems but focuses on **measuring** the **change** in contrast to focusing on
solid version control. Furthermore, the package allows for (possibly user made) text cleaning
functions that are applied before comparison. Another feature is the semi-automatic alignment
that allows for fast computer decissions on clear alignments of 100% matches and 0% matches
while asking for human input on more complex decissions.
