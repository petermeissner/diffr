Title: Comparing text but not like with diff.
Version: 0.1
Authors@R: "Peter Meißner <retep.meissner@gmail.com> [aut, cre]"
Description: A package for measuring change between different versions of text by automatically
  or semi-automatically aligning text lines and measuring the change. It works kind of like diff
  or version control systems but focuses on **measuring** the change in contrast to focusing on
  solid version control. Furthermore, the package allows for (possibly user made) text cleaning
  functions that are applied before comparison. Another feature is the semi-automatic alignment
  that allows for fast computer decissions on clear alignments of 100% matches and 0% matches
  while asking for human input on more complex decissions.
